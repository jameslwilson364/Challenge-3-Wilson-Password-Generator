# Challenge-3-Wilson-Password-Generator

## Description

The challenge for week 3 was to add a password generator to the existing html page.

- What was your motivation? This was challenging, but rewarding after seeing it thru to a fully functional pasword generator.
- Why did you build this project? It was an interesting challenge to use JS's math functions to generate unique and random passwords
- What problem does it solve? The webpage will randomly generate passwords that will use a combination of what the user would like as inputs
- What did you learn? A ton to be honest. Using the math functions in the for loops was really interesting.

The main portions of the page that intended.

- Working password generator
- provide inputs to the user that prompt for password length
- provide inputs to the user that prompt for what types of characters to use (lower, upper, numbers, select special characters)
- Generate a unique and random password based on all of the inputs that the user provided
- Ensure that negative responses by the user are factored in to the functionality.
- Alert the user as to what parameters they have selected.
- Return the value of the password generated in the correct section of the html.

Thanks to the folks at both MDN and W3. The walkthrough on math.floor, appending new values to an array, and converting arrays back into strings were particularly helpful.
